## JobJourney
This is an application I've built for a few reasons:
- Help with my own job search.
- Learn more about vector databases, embeddings, and similarity searches.
- Learn more about how the new App router works with NextJS

### The Idea
So my idea was to build something to help keep track of all my successes, failures, and everything in between in my career. Often times, these scenarios are used to answer behavioral questions, so I thought it would be great to catalog these to help with interview preparation.

## Tech
- NextJS 13 / React
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI
- Supabase (Postgres with pgvector addon)
- react-hook-form
- Zod (client + server side validation)
- OpenAI
- Transformers.js (for embeddings generation)
