  'When I was working on the frontend of a project called “Postal Engage”, I was assigned a specific page. I started building the page according to the designs in Figma, sent to us by our designer and attached to the ticket in Jira. Once I was done, it turned out that those designs weren’t actually complete yet. What we ended up doing was creating a new Jira board just to track the progress of designs. This ultimately helped engineering and design stay more closely aligned.'

  'I made some really cool stuff here, but one frustrating situation was when I was working on a page with a lot of data on it. My boss wanted to add even more data, but I was struggling to know how to incorporate it without making the design way too cluttered. We ended up compromising and meeting in the middle with some things.'
